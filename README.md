Chatty App
=====================

Chatty App is a client-side single-page application that allows multiple users to chat with each other. The client-side app is built with ReactJS, and communicates with a server via WebSockets for multi-user real-time updates.

npm start
open http://localhost:3001
```

Clone the repo to your local machine.
```
git clone git@github.com:marianahorvat/chattyApp.git
cd chattyApp
```
Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).

Start the client server:
```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
